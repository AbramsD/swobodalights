	<h1>Sorry!</h1>
	<p>
	The shows been run a lot lately.   I'm giving the neighbors a bit of a rest.
	I'll re-enable the ability to launch this show in <%=showsresettime%> minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
	The show also runs automatically at the top of the hour until:
	<li>Sun-Thurs: 10pm</li>
	<li> Fri-Sat: 12 midnight</li>
	</p>
	Come back Again!
